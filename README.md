# Silver Tsunami Analysis
In this report we analyze the retirement situation and determine what actions will be necessary to deal with the potential retirement of a significant share of the employee population.

## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis will determine:
a) the number of current employees who will soon be eligible for retirement, and
b) the number of employees who will be eligible for a mentorship program.

## Results
### Current Employee Analysis

#### Retiring Employees
* The Retirement Titles table lists detailed information on employees nearing retirement. The spreadsheet includes current employees who were born between 1952 and 1955.
* The Unique Titles table is a subset of the Retirement Titles table. It includes only employees' current titles.
* The Retiring Titles table provides a count by business function (title) where the employees will be eligible for retirement. This summarizes the data and shows which departments are most exposed to employee retirements.

#### Employees Eligible for Mentorship
* The Mentorship Table lists all current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.
* The total number of employees in this table was 1,549.
* The mentorship eligibility table is totaled by title.

## Summary
There is a large number of employees who will be eligible for retirement (90,398). This is a substantial portion of the workforce. An initial count shows
that there are approximately 240,124 employees. This represents about 37% of the workforce.

Another issue is that, based on report listing those eligible for the mentorship program (1549), there is still a huge gap in number of employees and expertise.

Here are three possible solutions to consider:
* Incentivize some nearing-retirement employees to continue working.
* Initiate extensive hiring in the most exposed areas.
* Extend the mentorship program age to include more employees than solely those born in 1965.
